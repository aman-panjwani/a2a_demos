## Welcome to my A2A Demos Repo 
A space where I explore and prototype ideas using Google’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This repository captures learnings, patterns, and fun experiments 🎯 around building multi-agent systems and workflows powered by A2A.

Whether you're curious about how agents can communicate, collaborate, or coordinate using A2A or you're just looking for inspiration this space is all about hands-on discovery 🧪.

## What is A2A?

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is a protocol developed by Google to enable seamless communication and coordination between AI agents. It allows agents to pass messages, delegate tasks, share context, and collaborate more effectively all through a standardized, interoperable interface.

The protocol is designed to support complex, multi-agent workflows where agents can act semi-autonomously while still maintaining shared goals and context. It introduces primitives like messages, tasks, intents, and shared memory to make inter-agent communication more natural and flexible.

In this repo, I use A2A as a playground 🧠 to explore these capabilities testing how agents can interact in various conceptual setups.

## What to Expect Here

This repository is a sandbox for ideas that rocks the production 💥

You'll find:

- 🧩 Lightweight prototypes demonstrating A2A concepts in action  
- 🤝 Explorations of agent collaboration patterns (like delegation, chaining, or decision sharing)  
- 📝 Commentary and notes on what works, what breaks, and what seems promising  
- 🔁 Incremental builds rather than finished solutions think of each folder as a narrative experiment

If you're interested in how agents can work together using A2A, you’re in the right place.

## Repo Structure

This repo is organized around standalone experiments:

- **`a2a_multi_agent/`**  
  An exploration of multi-agent interaction using A2A. This folder includes:  
  - Demonstration scripts & examples showing agents interacting via A2A.

As the repo grows, each new folder will follow a similar pattern a self-contained sandbox 🏖️ for a specific A2A concept or workflow.

## How to Navigate

Each top-level folder in this repo is a focused experiment with its own context.

To explore:

1. **Start with the folder's `README.md`** it explains what the experiment is about.  
2. **Look at the code and flow** most experiments include scripts or examples that can be run or adapted.  
3. **Follow the comments and notes** I often include inline thoughts, learnings, or ideas for improvement 💡

## Maintainer Note

This is a solo-maintained repository 🙋‍♂️ built purely out of curiosity and excitement around A2A.

Everything here is a work-in-progress experiments may evolve, break, or get completely rewritten. I’ll continue to add more demos and notes as I explore new patterns and agent behaviors.
